        Ever since I started my computer science program in 2019, I've been on a
        mission to learn as much as possible. It took me a while to finally find
        a tech stack that I really and truly enjoyed working on. I thought it
        was java. But eventually I landed on Javascript, more specifically
        react. I've enjoyed building sites with various different stacks and I
        would love an opportunity to show off my skills
