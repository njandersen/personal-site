        Ever since I started my computer science program, I've been on a mission
        to learn as much as possible. It took me a while to finally find a tech
        stack that I really and truly enjoyed working on. But eventually I
        landed on Javascript, more specifically react. The current tech stack I
        am focused on is Next.js, Firebase and Tailwind. I've built a lot of
        cool sites with this stack and I feel it works really well. I would love
        the chance to show what I know and grow as a developer.
