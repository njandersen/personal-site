        Through my classes I have been exposed to many different languages and
        tools. Like Java and C++ for instance. Just recently I learned about
        Docker and containerization of projects. What I have enjoyed the most
        though is my personal web projects. I have learned a great deal about
        building backend REST API’s and frontend SPA’s. I am always searching to
        grow as a developer and look forward to more opportunities to do so.
